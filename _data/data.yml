career-profile:
    title: About me
    summary: |
      I have worked as a freelance programmer for 2 years, helping my parernts by creating websites for their job's appointment schedule(online appointment). As for gamming it's just a free-time hobby nothing special, I preffer web design and databases than game design, but you never know. Drawing is another hobby of me I mostly like comics cause I can create characters and stories. As a character I'm not the person who can concentrate on a work for long time, that's why I prefer to make schdules about my work for each day.
